Interacting with Oracle Database
=================================
Approach-1 
----------
Using Command Line Interface(CLI) oracle Database i.e.,Sql*plus

  Start Menu >> Search Word "sql" >> Find option "Run SQL Command Line" >> Select that Option will open SQL Prompt


     SQL >>  Connect 


     Enter Username ::: System

     Enter Password ::: manager(not visible)

     Connected


     SQL >> show user

      OUTPUT
      ======
       system

 
      SQL >> Select * from all_users;  >> To get all the users information from Oracle Database

       OUTPUT
       ======
         Users Information

      SQL>> cl scr  >>> Clearing the Screen


      SQL >> exit   >>> Exiting the SQL Prompt

Approach-2 
----------
>>  By Using Oracle WebPage we can interact with Oracle Database and during installation of Oracle11g Express Edition we got      one webpage into our Machine Desktop  i.e., "Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition"


>>  When we Open the following page i.e.,Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition by default it will given you an
 
    error because need to configure the Oracle Port Listener Number(8080) for this webPage.


>>> Adding the Oracle Listener Port Number to the above web page

    Right Click on the web page >>> choose an option "Open File Location" >>> select "Get Started" Page and Right click on  
    this page >>> Select the option "Properties" >> Change the url as below

          Exisiting URL ::::    http://127.0.0.1:%HTTPPORT%/apex/f?p=4950 

 
          Changed URL   ::::   http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex/f?p=4950 

>>> After the doing the Above url change now just try to open the Same Page.....Will be getting Some Home Page 

    Select option "Application Express" >> will getting another Screen infront of you

             Create Database User  >>> Create new User (Select this Option)

    Application Express Workspace  >>> mahesh

                 Password          >>> ashokit (Invisible Characters)

       Confirm Password            >>> ashokit (Invisible Characters)


   We need to Click on button  "Create Workspace" >>After clicking on it will get Success Message workspace got created.

       1) SQL Commands    >>> Here we can write the required Sql Commands to test with oracle Database


       2) Object Browser  >>> We can see the Oracle Database Objects information (table,views,sequences,SP,SF etc.,)

                          >>> Using this option we can create any Database Object using graphical Objects.
