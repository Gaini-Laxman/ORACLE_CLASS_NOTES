Last Session
============
* We completed three types of Joins(InnerJoin,Left Join,Right Join)

* Inner Join are also called as "Equi Join" it will fetch only matched records from both tables.

* Left Join are also called as "Left outer Join" it will fetch matched Records + additional records from left table which are  
  not matched with join condition.

* Right join are alo called as "Right Outer Join" It will fetch matched records + additional records from right table which 
  are not matched with Join condition.

4) Full Join
=============
 * Full Join is also called as Full Outer Join.

 * When we are working Full Outer Join (or) Full Join Consider below as formula

   Full Join = Inner Join + Additional Records from left table (returns null value for any column fetched from right table).
                  
                          + Additional Records from Right table(returns null value for any column fetched from left table).
Query
=====
-- Full join (Inner Join Results + Additional Records from Left table + Additional Records from Right table)
select ae.emp_id,ae.emp_name,ad.dept_name,ae.dept_id,ad.dept_id
from ashokit_emp ae full join ashokit_dept ad 
on ae.dept_id = ad.dept_id
order by ae.emp_id;

OUTPUT
======
E1	Anil		SALES		D7	D7
E2	Avinash		IT		D1	D1
E3	Raju		HR		D2	D2
E4	Raghavendra	ADMIN		D4	D4
E5	Abdul		MARKETING	D6	D6
E6	Gupta		IT		D1	D1
E7	Bhavya		SALES		D7	D7 -----------------Inner Join Results join condition is matching
E8	SUNIL		null		D11	null
E9	ABHI		null		D12	null......(E8 & E9)...Left Table Records join condition is not matching
null	null		NON-ADMIN	null	D5
null    null		FINANCE		null	D3....................Right Table Records join condition is not matching


NOTE
====
* In the Realtime mostly we are going to work with following joins "Inner,Left Join,Right Join,Full Join,Self Join"

5) Cross join
=============
 * Cross join is also called as cartesian product.

 * While working with cross join no need to specify the join condition in on clause (or) where clause.

 * If we are joining two tables by using cross join every row in left table is mapped with every row in right table.

SQL
===
Q) Write a query to fetch employee name and their corresponding department name also make sure to display company name &       company location for every employee.

SQL>>>> select ae.emp_name,coalesce(ad.dept_name,'NO-DEPARTMENT') as dname,
       ci.company_name,ci.company_location from 
       ashokit_emp ae left join ashokit_dept ad on ae.dept_id = ad.dept_id 
       cross join companies_info ci order by ae.emp_name;

OUTPUT
======
ABHI		NO-DEPARTMENT	ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
Abdul		MARKETING	ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
Anil		SALES		ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
Avinash		IT		ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
Bhavya		SALES		ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
Gupta		IT		ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
Raghavendra	ADMIN		ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
Raju		HR		ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD
SUNIL		NO-DEPARTMENT	ASHOKIT	HYDERABAD


6) Natural Join
===============
  * If we are joining the two tables using word called "Natural Join" at this time no need to join condition explictly by         the programmer because Oracle Engine will add the join condition automatically based on common column names between         database tables.

  * If We don't have any common columns between the database tables oracle engine will perform cartesian product (cross join)

--natural join
select ae.emp_id,ae.emp_name,ad.dept_name 
from ashokit_emp ae natural join ashokit_dept ad 
order by ae.emp_id;

OUTPUT
======
E1	Anil	SALES
E2	Avinash	IT
E3	Raju	HR
E4	Raghavendra	ADMIN
E5	Abdul	MARKETING
E6	Gupta	IT
E7	Bhavya	SALES
