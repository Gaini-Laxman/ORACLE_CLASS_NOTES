Yesterday Session:
==================
Example for Creating Parent-Child Table
=======================================
-- creating parent Table 
create table ashokit_companies_info(company_code varchar2(10),
                                    company_name varchar2(30) not null,
                                    country varchar2(50) not null,
                                    constraint ashokit_comp_cde_pk primary key(company_code)
                                    );
                                    
-- creating child table
create table ashokit_products_info(pid varchar2(10) primary key,
                                   pname varchar2(30) not null,
                                   pcost number,
                                   pmfg_dt date not null,
                                   pwarranty varchar2(50) not null,
                                   company_code varchar2(10),                                   
                                   constraint ashokit_comp_code_fk foreign key(company_code) 
                                   references ashokit_companies_info(company_code)
                                  );

-- Adding the Foreign Key after creating the table
alter table ashokit_products_info add constraint ASHOKIT_COMP_CODE_FK foreign key(company_code) 
REFERENCES ashokit_companies_info(company_code);

-- Dropping the Foreign Key Constraint 
ALTER TABLE ashokit_products_info DROP CONSTRAINT ASHOKIT_COMP_CODE_FK;

Syntax For creating Foreign Key
===============================
CREATE TABLE child_table (
    ...
    CONSTRAINT fk_name
    FOREIGN KEY(col1, col2,...) REFERENCES parent_table(col1,col2) 
    ON DELETE [ CASCADE | SET NULL ]
);

>> First, to explicitly assign the foreign key constraint a name, you use the CONSTRAINT clause followed by the name. The        CONSTRAINT clause is optional. If you omit it, Oracle will assign a system-generated name to the foreign key constraint.

>> Second, specify the FOREIGN KEY clause to defines one or more column as a foreign key and parent table with columns to        which the foreign key columns reference.

>> Third, use the ON DELETE clause to specify consequence when the rows in the parent table are deleted.

   ON DELETE CASCADE: if a row in the parent is deleted, then all the rows in the child table that reference the removed row                        will be deleted.

   ON DELETE SET NULL: if a row in the parent is deleted, then all the rows in the child table reference the removed row will                        be set to NULL for the foreign key columns.

IIQ) What is differences between defining the constraint at Column level & Table Level

>>>> If we are defining the constraint at column level oracle engine will get assigned constraint name as predefined number.
       Ex: SYS_008975

>>>> If we  are defining the constratint at table level by using constraint clause programmer need to define our own       constraint name 

       Ex: ASHOKIT_COMP_CODE_FK;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IIQ) List all the constraints for a particular table ?
 
 SQL>> select * from user_constraints;  >>>>>> It will give you all the constraints in the Database.  

 SQL>> select * from user_constraints where table_name='ASHOKIT_PRODUCTS_INFO'; >>> Will provide table specific constraints
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SQL Operators
=============
Operator  >>>>> It is symbol representing the particular operation.

Operation >>>>> Collection of Operands and Operators 

Operands >>>>> Variables

 Example 
 =======
      a = 10; // operand

      b = 20; // operand

      c = a + b;  // 3 Operands (a,b,c), 2 Operators (=,+)

Oracle Supports following below operators

1) Arthimetic Operators : +,-,*,/,%

2) Relational Operators : >,>=,<,<=,=,<>

3) Logical Operators: and,or

4) Special Operators : between,notbetween,in,notin,like etc.,


Examples
========
select * from ashokit_products_info;
