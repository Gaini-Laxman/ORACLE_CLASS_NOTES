Last Session : We Completed with SQL Commands
=============================================

Today Session:
==============
1) Order by Clause

2) Understanding NULL values in Oracle

3) Working with Alias Names in Oracle


Order by Clause
===============
* In oracle ,Basically Table contains rows of information in unspecificed order regardless ways which rows are inserted into   Database.

* By using orderby clause we can query/retrieve the data from Database either ascending (or) Descending order.

* By default Order by clause will query/retrieve the data from Database in ascending order.

* If we want to retreive the data from database in descending order means, As DB Developer need to specify the "desc"     keyword in order by clause.

* We can apply the order by clause on any column name in the Database table.

* If we apply order by clause in character column then it will easy to populate data in alphabetical order.

* We can apply the order by clause on more than one column in the Database table.

* Whenever we need to submit the report to enduser in an understandable format then will use order by clause.

Syntax For Order By Clause
==========================
   
     select * from <table_name> order by <column_name> [asc/desc];


Example
=======
  
    select * from emp order by ename asc;  >>>>>> We are getting the List of employees in ascending order based on name;


Q) Dispaly all employee names in descending order

 ****** SQL >>> select ename from emp order by ename desc;

Q) Display employeeId,employeeName,Salary of an employees in descending order based on salary ?

 ****** SQL>>> select empno,ename,sal from emp order by sal desc;

Q) Display all employees information based on ename in ascending order

******* SQL>>> select * from emp order by ename;

Q) Display all employeee information whose working under job as "SALESMAN"

******  SQL>>> select * from emp where job='SALESMAN' order by ename;

        SQL>>> select * from emp where job='SALESMAN' order by ename desc;

Understanding NULL values in Oracle Database
=============================================
* In Database world, NULL is special.It is a marker for missing information or the information is not applicable.

* NULL is special in the sense that it is not a value like a number, character string, or datetime, therefore, you cannot   compare it with any other values like zero (0) or an empty string (”).

* We can test null values by using two conditions 

   1) is null

   2) is not null

1) is null
==========
 * By Using this condition we can find null values in particular Database Column.

Examples
========
 Q) Display all the product information whose produce price is null?

******* SQL>>>> select * from products where product_price is null;


 Q) Display all the employee information whose commision is null ?

******** SQL>> select * from emp where comm is null;

2) is not null
==============
 * It is used to finding the non-null values from the particular Database column


Examples
========
 Q) Display all the products information whose product price are not existed?
 
******* SQL>>> select * from products where product_price is not null;

 Q) Display all the employee information who earning the commision ?

******** SQL>>>> select * from emp where comm is not null;

Oracle Alias
============
* Alias is an duplicate name (or) alternate name for the original column name (or) table name (or) any expression name.

* Oracle supports the alias names for three levels

  1) Column level alias

  2) Table level alias

  3) Expression level alias

Column level alias
==================
 * Providing alias names for columns is known as  "Column level alias".

 * Whenever we need to provide understandable (or) meaningful report to the end user the we need to use alias name for    Database columns of an Database table

  Syntax
  =======
       select column-1 as "aliasname-Column1",
              column-2 as "aliasname-column2",
              ...............................
              ...............................
              column-n as "aliasname-columnn" from <table_name>;


  Example
  =======

   SQL>>>>>> select empno as "Employee No", ename as "Employee Name" from emp;         
            
   SQL>>>>>> select empno "Employee No", ename  "Employee Name" from emp;

   SQL>>>>>> select empno EmployeeNo, ename EmployeeName from emp;


2) Table name alias
===================
  * Providing the alias name to the Database table name.

 Syntax
 ======
   select * from <table_name> <alias_name>;

 Example
 ========
  SQL >>>> select * from emp;  --with out alias name for table

  SQL >>>> select * from emp e;  --Using alias name for table i.e., e

  SQL >>>> select e.* from emp e; --Using alias name for table i.e., e

  SQL >>>> select e.empno,e.ename,e.sal,e.comm from emp e;


3) Expression level Alias
==========================
  * Providing the alias names for the expressions is  known as "Expresesion level alias".

 Example
 ========
   SQL>>>>>> select empno,ename,sal,sal*12 "Annual Salary" from emp;
