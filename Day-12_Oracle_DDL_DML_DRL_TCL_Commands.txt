Yesterday Session
******************
* We Covered DDL Commands such "create,alter,drop,truncate,rename".

* Onces any Database table got dropped that dropped table will be stored in "Oracle Recyclebin".

     SQL >>> select * from recylebin;

* We get back the dropped table into Database space by using "flash command"

     SQL >>> flashback table <table_name> to before drop;

* To Display all the tables from the currently connected database

     SQL >>> select * from tab;

* How can we drop the user which we created earlier of mahesh,suresh,rajesh accounts
  
     SQL >>> drop user <user_name> cascade;  

  Example
  =======
     SQL >>> drop user rajesh cascade;

   OUTPUT
   ======
     User dropped.

  NOTE
  ====
   *** Make sure we need to connect with DBA Account(system/manager)

* To View all the users of an Oracle Database
 
    SQL >>> select * from all_users;

* We can delete the dropped table from oracle recycle bin with help of "purge" command

   SQL >>> purge table <table_name> 

   Example
   ========
   SQL >>> purge table maheshit_employees;

   OUTPUT
   ======
   Table purged.

* Differences between truncate and delete
 
  truncate
  =========
  1) It is a DDL Command.
  
  2) Truncate will leads to Permanent deletion of all records at a time.

  3) We cannot delete the specific record through truncate command.

  delete
  ======
  1) It is a DML Command.

  2) delete will leads to temporary deletion of all records (or) particular records.

  3) We can delete the specific record.


* Difference between truncate and Drop

  truncate and Drop both are DDL Commands.

  truncate will be focusing on data to be deleted permanently but it will not delete Database Structure.

  drop always focusing on deleting the database object structure permanently.
   
***************************
Today Session: SQL Commands 
***************************

 1) DDL Commands : Create,alter,drop,truncate,rename,flashback,purge >>>>>> All DDL Commands are by default "Auto Commit";

 2) DML Commands : insert,update,delete >>>>>>> All DML Commands are not by default "Auto Commit".

    NOTE
    ====
    *****When we are talking about update and delete commands we used "where" clause which can be used to specify the   
         condition for sql statements

    ***** If we are not using where clause in update statment (or) delete statement means it will perform update operation
              
          and delete operation on all rows of the database table.

 3) DQL/DRL Commands : select 

***************
Select Command
***************
  DQL >>> Data Query Language

  DRL >>> Data Retrevial Language

* This command is used to retreive the data from the existing table.

* By using this command we can retrieve all the records in the table and also we can retrieve specific recoreds from the  
  Database table.

   Syntax::
   ========
       select * from <table_name>;

       select * from <table_name> where <condition>;

   Example
   ========
       select * from emp;

       select * from emp where dept=10;

  >> In the above select command we are retrieving all the records from emp table

  >> * represent selecting all columns from emp table

  **********
  selection
  **********
  >> Retrieving the data from Database table completely or partially based on condition 
   
   Example:
   ========
      select * from emp;
 
      select * from emp where deptno=10;

  **********
  Projection
  **********
  >>> Retreiving the data from specific columns of an Database table known as "Projection"

  >>> In projection we can't use * symbol in the select query.

   Example
   =======
     select empno,ename from emp;
 
     select empno,ename,job from emp;

     select empno,ename,job,sal from emp;

     select empno from emp;

     select empname from emp

4) Transaction Control Language(TCL) Commands ::commit,rollback,savepoint
==========================================================================
  
    commit >>> saving the information permanently in the database

    rollback >>> Undo Operation

    Savepoint >>>> Marking some of transaction as miletones

Transaction
===========
 * Any Operation which we can perform on the database by using DML Commands i.e.,insert,update,delete on the Database then 
   
   it is known as "Transaction"

Session
=======
 * It can be defined certain amount of time (or) interval given to user to perform some activities.

   During the Login to Logoff of an user what ever operation done by the user i.e.,Transactions

 * Basically sessions can be terminated in two ways

    1) Normal termination  >>> exit (or) quite   >>> Always save the data (or) transactions successfully

    2) Abnormal Termination >>>> Directly switching off the CPU, Directly Hit PowerOff Button etc., >>> Doesn't saves the 
                                 data (or) transactions successfully

**********
commit
**********
>> This command is used to save the transactions explictly from the moment of the user login to database to till execute 

   this command.

 Syntax
 =======
   commit


********
Rollback
********
>>> This command is used to discard all the transactions done on Database table before performing commit operation


Syntax
======
   rollback

Example Scenario on Commit and Rollback
=======================================

    User  >>>>>> Logged into DB   >>>>>> Insert(10),Update(10),delete(15) >>>> By Default this operations will not saved


    If we want to save all these operations permanently to the database table >>>> commit(SAVE)

 
    If we don't want to save all these operations into Database >>> Rollback (UNDO)
