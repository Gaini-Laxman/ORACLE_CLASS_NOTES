Yesterday Session
=================
1) Given script for office database tables

2) Completed with SET Operators in oracle.

3) Started the discusssion of Oracle Sequences.

Today Session
=============

Sequence
========
* Sequence is one of the oracle database object.

* Sequence in the oracle is used to generate numeric values dynamically for a database column of an table.

Use case
========
 1) You created with Database table with three columns (empId,empName,location)

 2) empId is primary key column(not null + duplicate values)

 3) while inserting the data into the employee table programmer need to supply the primary key column value explictly.

 4) Here we have one problem with primary key column programmer may have chance to supply the duplicate value for a primary       key column this will leads to unique constraint error in database.

 5) To avoid such problem programmer need to generate value for primary key column dynamically through sequence

* In order to create the sequence in the Oracle Database we need to follow the below syntax.
  
    CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
    [MINVALUE value]     >>>> default "1"
    [MAXVALUE value]     >>>> default "9999999999999999999999999999"
    [START WITH value] 
    [INCREMENT BY value] >>>> default "1"
    [CYCLE/NO CYCLE]     >>>> default no cycle
    [CACHE value];       >>>> default 20

Example
=======

Creating the sequence
=====================
SQL >>> create sequence ashokit_emp_seq;

SQL >>> create sequence maheshit_seq 
        MINVALUE 100
        maxvalue 1000
        start with 150
        increment by 2
        nocycle
        cache 25;

select the value from sequence using pseudo column(nextval)
===========================================================
    select ashokit_emp_seq.nextval from dual;

Getting to know about current value of sequence using pseudo column(currval)
===========================================================================
    select ashokit_emp_seq.currval from dual;

Getting to know about all sequences in database
===============================================
   select * from user_sequences;    >>>> user created sequences
 
   select * from all_sequences;     >>>> Predefined sequences + user defined sequence

dropping the sequences
======================
   drop sequence ashokit_emp_seq;

Utilize the sequence for a primary key column value
===================================================
* Today itself we are going the collect the value for primary key column through oracle database sequence.

* One most importance for Sequences are nothing but resuable database object means multiple tables can reuse the same   sequence.

       ashokit_courses >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> maheshit_seq

       ashokit_contact_info >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> maheshit_seq

* If we observe the data for the above two tables primary key columns values becomes not in sync.

ashokit_courses
===============
172	CoreJava	5000	09-JAN-23
174	AdvancedJava	6000	09-JAN-23
176	SpringBoot	7000	09-JAN-23
178	Microservice	8000	09-JAN-23
180	AngularJS	9000	09-JAN-23
186	Devops		15000	09-JAN-23
188	AWS		12000	09-JAN-23

ashokit_Contact_info
====================
182	Ashok	123456
184	Mahesh	123456

* To overcome the above problem as database programmer we need to create database sequence per database table

         ashokit_courses  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ashokit_courses_seq

         ashokit_contacts >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ashokit_contacts_seq

         ashokit_students >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ashokit_students_seq

         ashokit_emp      >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ashokit_emp_seq


* For the above two tables we will be creating two sequences independently


Creating sequence for ashokit_courses table
===========================================
create sequence ashokit_courses_seq
minvalue 1000
maxvalue 10000
start with 1010
increment by 1
cache 50;

creating sequence for ashokit_contact_info table
================================================
create sequence ashokit_contact_info_seq
minvalue 5000
maxvalue 15000
start with 5020
increment by 1
cache 50;

No cycle
========
create sequence test_seq
minvalue 1
maxvalue 5
start with 1
increment by 1
cache 5;

-- selected for 5 times and when we are selecting the 6th time getting below error
select test_seq.nextval from dual;

ERROR
=====
ORA-08004: sequence TEST_SEQ.NEXTVAL exceeds MAXVALUE and cannot be instantiated
08004. 00000 -  "sequence %s.NEXTVAL %s %sVALUE and cannot be instantiated"
*Cause:    instantiating NEXTVAL would violate one of MAX/MINVALUE
*Action:   alter the sequence so that a new value can be requested


cycle
=====
create sequence demo_seq
minvalue 1
maxvalue 5
start with 1
increment by 1
cycle
cache 4;

select demo_seq.nextval from dual;

NOTE
====
The above sequence is used to upto 5 values onces it reached to 5th values again resetted to 1..

Assignment
==========
1) How to reset the database sequence and which properties are allowed for resetting ?
