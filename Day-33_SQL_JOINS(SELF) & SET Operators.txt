Yesterday Session
=================
1) We Completed several types of SQL Joins

   1) Inner Join

   2) Left Join

   3) Right Join

   4) Full Join

   5) Cross Join

   6) Natural Join  >>> If there is common columns between database tables then oracle will give inner join results.
                        
                        If there is no common columns between database tables then oracle will given you cross join results


  Important Join Types for Realtime Application Development: Inner,Left Join,Right Join,Full Join,Self Join.

Today Session : 
===============
7) Self Join
============
* A self join is a join in which a table is joined with itself.

* To join a table itself means that each row of the table is combined with itself and with every other row of the table.

* The table appears twice in the FROM clause and is followed by table aliases that qualify column names in the join     condition.

* The self join can be viewed as a join of two copies of the same table. The table is not actually copied, but SQL performs     the command as though it were.

* To perform a self join, Oracle Database combines and returns rows of the table that satisfy the join condition

Syntax-1
========
  SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name... FROM table1 a, table1 b  WHERE a.common_filed = b.common_field;

Syntax-2
========
  SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name... FROM table1 a, join table1 b on a.common_filed = b.common_field;

Example on Self Join
====================
select e.ename||' Works Under Manager '||m.ename as "Employee_Manager_Name"
from emp e join emp m
on e.mgr = m.empno
order by e.ename;

OUTPUT
======
ADAMS Works Under Manager SCOTT
ALLEN Works Under Manager BLAKE
BLAKE Works Under Manager KING
CLARK Works Under Manager KING
FORD Works Under Manager JONES
JAMES Works Under Manager BLAKE
JONES Works Under Manager KING
MARTIN Works Under Manager BLAKE
MILLER Works Under Manager CLARK
SCOTT Works Under Manager JONES
SMITH Works Under Manager FORD
TURNER Works Under Manager BLAKE
WARD Works Under Manager BLAKE

=========================
More Example on Self Join
=========================

Family
======

Member_id        Name         age          parent_id
---------        -----        ----         ---------
F1               Ashok         4               F5
F2               Mahesh        10              F5
F3               Johnson       12              F5
F4               Suresh        36              null
F5               Naresh        40              F6
F6               Rajesh        19              null
F7               Avinash       20              F4
F8               Anil          22              F4

Write Query to fetch the child name and their age corresponding to thier parent name.

SQL>>> Select f1.name || ' Parent is ' || f2.name
       from family f1 left join family f2 
       on f1.parent_id = f2.member_id 
       order by f2.member_id;

1) Practise the Joins using emp table and dept table

2) Practise the Joins using office database (ashokit_dept,ashokit_managers,ashokit_emp,ashokit_projects)

3) Utilize online resources try to write join's on sample database table data they give.
