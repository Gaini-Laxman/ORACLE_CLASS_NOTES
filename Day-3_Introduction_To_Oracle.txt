Yesterday : Different Types of Database Softwares
=================================================
* Database is meant for Storing data of an Application

* Always Data will be Populated into Database from Several Application.

   Ex: Internet Banking >> we are performing some transaction on day-2-day Activities this will leads generate data into                            database

* We have two types of Database Softwares are available in Market

    1) SQL Databases (or) RDBMS Databases  : Oracle,MySQL,SQLServer,PostgreSQL,DB2,Derby DB etc.,
       
       > In RDBMS/SQL Databases always data will be stored in two dimensional format i.e.,Tables

       > Table will contains Rows & Columns, Always Columns represented as "Fields" and Rows represented as "tuples" and          Table represented as "Relation".

       > In RDBMS/SQL Databases always data will be stored in "Structured Format".

       > In Realtime most of banking application,e-commerce application are using RDBMS Database Softwares only.

   2) No-SQL Database (or) NRDBMS Databases : MongoDB,Cassandar,Redis,Hbase,DynamoDB etc.,

        >> Data will be stored in Several Kinds of Formats (or) Unstructured Format
             - Document based Databases
             - Key-value Pair Databases
             - Coulumn wise Databases
             - Graph Databases

      		 Training Program will be focusing on SQL Databases i.e., Oracle,MySQL

SQL
===
 * SQL Stands for Structured Query Language.

 * SQL is used to communicate with any RDBMS Database Softwares.

 * SQL is database Query language/ database Programming language.

 * As End user we can pass statements to execute in Database such statements called "SQL Statements / Queries"  

 * SQL Statements are just like normal English Statements.
 
 * We can write the SQL Statements either in upper case letters (or) lower case letters i.e.,SQL is case-Insensitive Database    programming language.

 * SQL Language becomes ANSI(American National Standard Information) Standard will becomes common language for any RBDMS   
   
   Datbase softwares /SQL Databases Softwares

 * When we writing the SQL Statements every SQL statement must be terminated with Semicolon(;)

 * In SQL at atime only one SQL Statement will be executed.

 * If we wanted to execute some bunch of SQL Statements at time for your business requirement we need to go for "PLSQL".

 * Procedural Language using SQL.


   Example
   =======
         Customers(Table)
         ===============         
         Customer_Id          Customer_Name              Customer_Location
         ===========          ==============             =================
           1025                  Mahesh                    Hyderabad   
           1026                  Suresh                    Delhi	
           1027                  Rajesh 		   Bangalore    
           1028                  Nagesh                    Chennai      
           1029                  Naresh                    Pondicherry  

   
If we store the above customers information into database we can get the particular customers information based on our business requirement in easy manner

   EndUser  >> Writing SQL Statement >> Based On Business Requirement (Need to get All Customers Information belongs to                                                                              Hyderabad)

      select * from customers where customer_location='Hyderabad';  >> SQL Statement  (or) Query  

                                                                    >> Milli Seconds the information will be infront of you.

      OUTPUT
      ======
       Customer_Id          Customer_Name              Customer_Location
       ===========          ==============             =================
          1025                  Mahesh                    Hyderabad  

      select * from customers;  >> It will give you all customers information

      OUTPUT
      ======
         Customer_Id          Customer_Name              Customer_Location
         ===========          ==============             =================
           1025                  Mahesh                    Hyderabad   
           1026                  Suresh                    Delhi	
           1027                  Rajesh 		   Bangalore    
           1028                  Nagesh                    Chennai      
           1029                  Naresh                    Pondicherry  

   
        Wanted to get the customerID based on Customer Name

        select customer_id from customer where customer_name='Mahesh';

       OUTPUT
       ======
           Customer_Id
