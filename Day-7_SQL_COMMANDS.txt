Last Session
============
* We Seen How to Interact with oracle Database Software using three appproach

   1) Command Line Interface(CLI) i.e., SQL*Plus

   2) Web page 

   3) Graphical User Interface(GUI) i.e., Oracle SQL Developer, Toad For Oracle etc.,   >>> Trending Market

Oracle Accounts
===============
1) Database Administrator Account(DBA) Account i.e., sys(or)system (Manager)

2) We created some Database User using WebPage Approach  i.e.,rajesh(ashokit),mahesh(ashokit)

3) We will create one Database user using CLI Approach i.e.,ramesh(ashokit)

  Step-1 : Creating the user using CLI Screen
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     SQL> create user ramesh identified by ashokit;

      User created.

    NOTE:
    =====
     >>  Database Username : ramesh and Database Password: ashokit


  Step-2 : Giving the Permissions to Newly Created User i.e.,ramesh
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     SQL> grant resource,connect to ramesh;

     Grant succeeded.

    NOTE: After Creating the User make sure we need to give permissions for Creating Database Objects       
          (Table,Sequence,Index,view,Stored procedure,Stored Function etc.,)

 
  Step-3 : Connecting to Newly Created User Using CLI Approach
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   SQL> connect
  
    Enter user-name: ramesh
   
    Enter password:ashokit(Invisible)
   
    Connected.

  
NOTE:
====
* We can always create an new Database user account through DBA Account only.


* We can't create newly Database user account from another User account.
