Yesterday Session
=================
* We completed the SQL Operators 
   1) Arthimetic Operators
   2) Relational Operators
   3) Logical Operators
   4) Special Operators
        - between
        - not between
        - in
        - not in
        - like
        - is null
        - is not null

* Do we have tables of emp & dept in DBA Account(System/Manager) or not ??? NO 

Live Script for Oracle Emp & Dept table
=======================================
https://apexplained.wordpress.com/2013/04/20/the-emp-and-dept-tables-in-oracle/

* If we created the one Database User(mahesh/ashokit) in that user by default will get emp & dept table.
Today Session :: Working with SQL Functions
===========================================
* A Function is a self contained block of statements which performs the particular task.

* The main of advantage of using functions is "Code Reusability".

* Every Function will always returns only one value.

* Basically SQL Functions are categorized into two 
   
   1) System defined Functions

   2) User defined Functions

System Defined Functions
========================
   A Function which is defined by the system along with software such functions are called "system defined functions (or) 
   predefined functions".

User Defined Functions
======================
   A Functions which is defined by the user (or) programmer such functions are called "User Defined Functions".


>>> In SQL System defined Functions are further divided into three types

    1) Single Row Functions
    =======================
    These Functions will work on every record in the Database table and return more than one value.

    2) Multi(or) Multiple Row Functions
    ====================================
    These Functions will work on entire Database table and returns only one value.

    3) Miscellaneous Functions
    ==========================
     These Functions will work on null values of Database table column.

      
>>>  In Oracle Database we can have two types of tables

       1) Database Tables
       ==================
        * A Database table is a table which contains actual information of an entity

        Ex: emp,dept,ashokit_customers,ashokit_products_info,ashokit_companies_info etc., 

       2) Non Database Tables
       ====================== 
        * A Non Database Table is a table which doesn't contains any information in table.
        
        Ex : In oracle database we have one non-Database table i.e.,dual sometimes we can call it is an "Temporary Table".
       
        * The Purpose of the dual table (or) temporary table is to hold some values for an SQL Statements/SQL Expressions

        * We have three advantages of this dual table 

          1) Evaluating the Mathematical Expression i.e., 2+3+5+8/2

              -- Evaluating the Math Expression using dual table 
	      -- Added column alias names
              select (2+3+4+5)/2 "Expression" from dual;
              select (2+3+4+5)/2 as "Division Operation" from dual;

          2) Evaulating the pseudo column values
            
               -- Wanted to know about current date from oracle
               select sysdate from dual;

          3) Evaulating the predefied functions

               -- Finding the length of given string 
              select length("Welcome To Ashok IT") from dual;

 1) Single Row Functions
    =======================
    These Functions will work on every record in the Database table and return more than one value.

    1) length(): This function is used to find the length of given characters which include white spaces

       Ex: select length('Welcome To Hyderabad') from dual;
            
           select ename,length(ename) from emp;

    2) initcap() : This function is used to convert the first letter of every word into capital letter
 
       Ex: select initcap('Welcome to ashok it hyderabad') from dual;

       O/P: Welcome To Ashok It Hyderabad

    3) chr(): This function return the high level language code from ASCII Value
        
        Ex: select chr(122) from dual;
        
        O/P :z

    4) ascii(): This function return the ascii value form high level language code
      
        Ex: select ascii('a') from dual

    5) upper() : This function is used to convert into upper case from given case of letters

        Ex: select upper('mahesh') from dual

    6) lower():  This function is used to convert into lower case from given case of letters(uppers)

        Ex: select lower('MAHESH') form dual;

    7) reverse(): This funciton is used to reverse of given string

        Ex: select reverse('Mahesh') from dual;
    
    8) trim(): This function removes the white spaces from both left and right hand side of the given string

        Ex: select trim(' Welcomt To Ashok IT Hyderabad   ') from dual;

            select length(' Welcomt To Ashok IT Hyderabad   '),length(trim(' Welcomt To Ashok IT Hyderabad   ')) from dual;
  
    9) ltrim(): This function only removes the white spaces form left hand side of given string

         Ex: select ltrim('       Welcome To Ashok IT      ') from dual
        
   10) rtrim(): This function only removes the white spaces from right hand side of given string
 
        Ex: select rtrim('       Welcome To Ashok IT      ') from dual;


   11) lpad() : This function add the specificed charaters from the left hand side of the given string

         Ex: select lpad('Ashok IT',15,'*') from dual;

   12) rpad() : This function add the specificed charaters from the right hand side of the given string

         Ex: select rpad('Ashok IT',15,'*') from dual;

   13) translate(): This function replaces the given string with another string

         Ex: select translate('JACKJ','J','B') from dual;
