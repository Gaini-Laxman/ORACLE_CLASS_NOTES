SQL Commands
============
* SQL Commands is nothing but SQL Statements (or) SQL Queries.

* Basically Statement represents preforming the particular task (or) Statement is group of predefined Words
   
   Example : select * from emp;

* Every Statement must be terminated by Semicolon.

* The Statement which we are Passed to Database Software System such statements is called as "SQL Statements".

* Basically SQL Commands/SQL Statements are Categorized as below

   1) Data Definition Language(DDL) Commands (or) DDL Statements  

      >> Deals with Creating/Modifying/Dropping Structure of Database Objects.

      >> DDL Commands are "create, alter, drop,truncate"

   2) Data Manipulation Lanaguage(DML) Commands (or) DML Statements
      
       >> Deals with Data of an Database objects

       >> DML Commands are "insert, update,delete"     

   3) Data Control Language(DCL) Commands (or) DCL Statements
       
       >> Deals with giving the Permission (or) Revoking the permisssion of an users
 
       >> DCL Commands are used By "DBA Persons"

       >> DCL Commands are "grant,revoke"       

   4) Date Retrevial Language(DRL) Commands (or) DRL Statements

       >> Deals with Retreving the data from Database objects

       >> DRL Commands are "select"

   5) Transaction Control Language(TCL) Commands (or) TCL Statements

       >> Deals with Transaction Management
  
       >> TCL Commands are "commit,rollback,savepoint"

NOTE
====
Database Objects in Oracle : Tables,Views,Sequences,indexes,Stored Procedures,Stored Functions etc.,
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Today Session : (Database Object >> Table)
==========================================

* To Create a Database Object of an Table we need to use DDL Command of "create".

* After Creating the Database object of an Table in Database, as programmer we need to insert data into table then we need to 
  use DML command "insert".

* After Inserting the data into Database as programmer we need to validate the information by using DRL Command "select"


Example : Creating sample Database table 
========================================
Write a Query for Creating Database Table of "customers" information with following fields                    >  CustomerId     >>  only numbers
                >  CustomerName   >>  string
                >  Gender         >>  string
                >  Age            >>  only numbers
                >  location       >>  string

Step-1
======
>> In order to create the Database table we will use DDL Command "create" and observe the syntax as below

              create table <table_name>(
                                           <column_name_1> <Datatype>,
                                           <column_name_2> <Datatype>,
                                           ...........................
                                           ...........................
                                           ...........................
                                           <column_name_n> <Datatype>,
          
                                       );

      NOTE: Naming Conventions need to be follow for any name in Oracle Database
      ==========================================================================
      1) Every name in Database must begins with "Alphabet".

      2) We need to follow the mentioned charset i.e.,a-z,A-Z,0-9,@,$,#,_

      3) Names are not Case Sensitive.
 
      4) Predefined keywords are not allowed.

      5) Blank Spaces are also not allowed in the names.

  
      Query For Creating Database table 
      =================================
      SQL> create table ashokit_customers(
                                   customer_id number,
                                   customer_name varchar(50),
                                   gender varchar(15),
                                   age number,
                                   location varchar(50)
                                  );

      OUTPUT
      ======
      Table Created

Step-2: 
=======
 * Inserting the data into Database table by using DML Command "insert"


  Syntax For Insert Command 
  ==========================   
   1) insert into <table_name>(column_name_1,column_name_2.................column_name_n) values(value1,value2,.....valuen);

  Example
  =======
    insert into ashokit_customers(customer_id,customer_name,gender,age,location) values(01,'Mahesh','Male',35,"Hyderabad");

    insert into ashokit_customers(customer_id,customer_name,gender,age,location) values(02,'Ashok','Male',35,"Hyderabad");

  
  2) insert into <table_name> values(value1,value2,value3,value4..................valuen);

  Example
  =======
    insert into ashokit_customers values(03,'Rajesh','Male',40,'Mumbai');

  3) insert into <table_name> values(&customerId,&customername,&gender,&age,&location);



Step-3
======
 * Just Validating the Information by selecting data from Database Table using DRL Command "select"

    Syntax for Select Command
    =========================
       select * from <table_name>;   >> Retrieves all the information from given table

   Example 
   =======
      select * from ashokit_customers;

NOTE
====
 sql >> set linesize 300;
