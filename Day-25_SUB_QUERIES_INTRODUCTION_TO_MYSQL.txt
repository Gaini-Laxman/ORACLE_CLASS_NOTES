Today Session : SUB QUERIES
===========================
* A Query with in a Query is Known as Sub Query (or) Nested Query (or) Inner Query.

* When ever We required to execute one Query depending on another Query result then we need to use Sub Queries.

* Sub queries are preferable to display output from one table and having an input value from other table.

* When we are working with Sub Queries always first execute's the inner query and then will execute Outer Query means Outer     Query always executed depending on Inner Query result.

**********************************
Execution Process For Sub Queries
**********************************
>> The execution process is always from innermost query to the outermost.

>> Outer query <-----------o/p<------------ Inner query <----------o/p <---------Inner query

*******
Syntax
*******
>>  select ..... from table...where [=/IN/exists/not exists](select ..... from table......where....[=/IN/exits/not exists]
    (select.......).....);

*******
Example
*******
SQL >>> select * from emp where sal = (select max(sal) from emp);  >>> Getting Highest Salary of Employee Details

SQL >>> select * from emp where sal in (select min(sal) from emp); >>> Getting Lowest Salary of Employee Details


******************
Types of Sub Query
******************
* Sub Queries are classified into two types.

     1) Single Row Sub Query

     2) Multi Row Sub Query

***********************
1) Single Row Sub Query
***********************
* A sub query/Inner Query which returns only one row of information then those query called as "Single Row Sub Query".

* Single row SubQuery returns only one row in two cases

Case-1: If We write select query based on primary key column (or) unique key column.

Case-2: If we are using aggregate functions in select query on database table.

**********************
2) Multi Row Sub Query
**********************
* A sub query/ Inner Query which returns more than one row of information then those query called as "Multi Row Sub Query"

* The Operators which we are using in multi row sub queries ar IN,ANY,ALL etc.,

************************
Working With Sub Queries
************************
Query-1: Display department details of employee smith?

SQL >> select * from dept where deptno IN(select deptno from emp where ename='SMITH');

Query-2: Display employee details who is working under SALES

SQL >> select * from emp where deptno=(select deptno from dept where dname='SALES');

Query-3: Display employee details whose salary is less than employee id as 7788 ?

SQL >> Select * from emp where sal <=(select sal from emp where empno=7788);

Query-4: Display employee details whose salary is less than 7788 and who are getting commission?

SQL >> select * from emp where sal <=(select sal from emp where empno=7788) and comm is not null;

Query-5: Display employee details who are working under Blake-Manager?

SQL >> select * from emp where mgr = (select empno from emp where upper(ename) ='BLAKE');

Query-6: Display employee details who are working in chicago ?

SQL >> select * from emp where deptno = (select deptno from dept where upper(location) ='CHICAGO');

Query-7: Display the employee details for second maximium salary.

SQL  >> select max(sal) from emp where sal < (select max(sal) from emp where sal < (select max(sal) from emp);

* The reason behind adding My is the daughter’s name of the MySQL’s co-founder, Monty Widenius.

* It is an Open Source Database when it comes for Oracle is Properitary License.

* As we discussed earlier By using Structured Query Language(SQL) We can interact with any RDBMS Database Software.

* SQL Commands are command for every database slightly datatypes will be changed from one database to another database.

* We can download the My SQL Database Software in the below URL
