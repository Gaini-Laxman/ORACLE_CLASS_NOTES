Yesterday Session
******************
Transaction Control Language(TCL) Commands :: (commit,rollback,savepoint)
=========================================================================
  
    commit >>> saving the information permanently in the database

    rollback >>> Undo Operation

    Savepoint >>>> It is used to save a set of transactions under a name

Transaction
===========
 * Any Operation which we can perform on the database by using DML Commands i.e.,insert,update,delete on the Database then 
   
   it is known as "Transaction"

Session
=======
 * It can be defined certain amount of time (or) interval given to user to perform some activities.

   During the Login to Logoff of an user what ever operation done by the user i.e.,Transactions

 * Basically sessions can be terminated in two ways

    1) Normal termination  >>> exit (or) quite   >>> Always save the data (or) transactions successfully

    2) Abnormal Termination >>>> Directly switching off the CPU, Directly Hit PowerOff Button etc., >>> Doesn't saves the 
                                 data (or) transactions successfully

******
commit
******
>> This command is used to save the transactions explictly from the moment of the user login to database to till execute 

   this command.

 Syntax
 =======
   commit


********
Rollback
********
>>> This command is used to discard all the transactions done on Database table before performing commit operation


Syntax
======
   rollback

Example Scenario on Commit and Rollback
=======================================

    User  >>>>>> Logged into DB   >>>>>> Insert(10),Update(10),delete(15) >>>> By Default this operations will not saved


    If we want to save all these operations permanently to the database table >>>> commit(SAVE)

 
    If we don't want to save all these operations into Database >>> Rollback (UNDO)

Savepoint
=========
* This command is used to save a set of transactions under a name.

 Syntax
 ======
    savepoint <save_point_name>;

Example
=======
   user >>>>> Logged into DB >>>> Insert(2)   >>>> Added One Savepoint      >>>> savepoint  insertSavePoint

                             >>>> Update(2)   >>>> Added one More SavePoint >>>>> savepoint updateSavePoint

   User >>>>> I can do "Rollback" Operation >> Insert(2),Update(2) will be discarded from Database.

   User >>>>> I can do "commit" Operation   >> Insert(2),Update(2) will be saved into Database permanently

   User >>>>> I can do "Rollback" to particular "Savepoint" 
 
        SQL>>> rollback to updateSavePoint >>> Only Update(2) will be discarded

        SQL>>> rollback to insertSavePoint >>>> only Insert(2) will be discarded

        SQL >>> Commit;   >>>>>> Nothing will be saved

DCL(Data Control Language)
==========================
 * This commands are used by DBA for granting permissions to users and Revoking the permission from users.

 * We have two DCL Commands i.e., grant, revoke

     grant >>>> providing the permissions
 
     revoke >>>> Takingout the permissions

SQL Commands
============
/** This Page is Related to DBA Administrator **/
